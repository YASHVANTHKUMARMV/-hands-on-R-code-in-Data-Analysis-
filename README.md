## Dependencies

To work with the code and materials in this repository, you'll need:

- R (version 3.5 or higher)
- RStudio (recommended)
- Common R libraries:
  - `tidyverse`
  - `ggplot2`
  - `dplyr`
  - `caret`
  - `rmarkdown`

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YASHVANTHKUMARMV/-hands-on-R-code-in-Data-Analysis-.git
   ```

2. Install required R packages:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "caret", "rmarkdown"))
   ```

3. Open the R scripts or R Markdown files and execute them in RStudio or R console.

## Usage

Each R script is self-contained and can be run independently. The scripts demonstrate various statistical techniques and data analysis workflows.
